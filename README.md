# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Summary

We completed a ETL and data analysis on a new dataset related to backers who have pledged to the live projects. As part of this we extracted the data from the file provided to put it into a readable format. We proceeded to complete an ERD to better visualize the connections between all the tables, especially paying attention to how our new table worked with the existing ones. We completed the analysis by capturing the e-mails to the campaign contacts to let them know how much is left till they reach their goal and to backers to let them know how far away their live project is away from it's goal.
